subject: Issue about Your Subscription in makeweb.io
content: |
  Hi #{displayname},

  We are here to inform you that the last payment for your #{plan} subscription plan was failed. We didn't receive the fund necessary for the pro plan you are currently using.

  Thus, we have to temporarily suspend your subscription for now; the plan for your account will return to free plan in makeweb.io - which still provides you with basic functionality to make a decent makeweb animation - until this issue is resolved. You can also contact us directly via this email to re-enable the plan if this issue is resolved.

  You can check and update your plan detail in the billing panel [https://makeweb.io/me/billing](https://makeweb.io/me/billing) after login to makeweb.io. Sorry for the inconvenience, and please don't hesitate if you find anything that we could help :)


  Cheers,
  Kirby
  founder of makeweb.io
